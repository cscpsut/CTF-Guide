- change nickname on discord

- explain what ctf is

- the pointing system is dynamic which means any challenge's worth is dependent on the number of solves

- which means all the challenges will have the same worth at the start regardless of difficulty 

- you being the first solver of a challenge doesn't mean you are garunteed max points (depending on how many people solve it)

- no extra points are awarded for firstblood

- Challnges that have asterisks in their name are jackpot challenges (first blood special prize)

- Do not DM any of the writers unless permitted otherwise

- you can @ the writers and ask for hints on this discord server in the respective category channel

- Read the rules in the rules channel

- don't waste time trying to attack ctfd as its the latest patch and unless you're a security researcher u wont find a vuln

- none of the web challenges need bruteforce whether parameter fuzzing/directory busting  (please don't)

- don't bombard ctfd as we have applied rate limiters, you'll think you slowed the site but its only slow for YOU

- backups are taken every 1 minute and in case of emergency ctf will be paused and everyone will be imformed

- some challenges have limited tries so be smart and dont brute force online
